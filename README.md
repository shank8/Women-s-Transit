Women-s-Transit
===============

PHP 5.0 MVC Web Application for Women's Transit

## Getting Started
I have altered the config.php, routes.php, and database.php so that it reflects what we want.  Make sure you have a
MySQL database running on localhost with a username="root", password="" and a schema called womenstransit. If you
do not have this, then you will need to change the respective files in Application/Config in order to get it working
on your own machine.
